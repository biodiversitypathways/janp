"Note: Data for shorebirds are only available beginning in 1980. This analysis is based on 331 species that are representative of their ecological group and for which adequate monitoring data were available. Of the 331 species, 193 species are included in more than 1 species group based on their feeding or habitat requirements. For example, species grouped in the aerial insectivores feeding behaviour category may also be included in the forest birds group.",,,
